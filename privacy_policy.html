        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Privacy Policy for SQL Parser Google Apps Script</h1>
        <p class="text-muted text-center">Effective Date: 9 Oct 2024</p>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how the SQL Parser Google Apps Script (“the Service”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Service through the Google Workspace Marketplace. By using the Service, you agree to the terms outlined below. If you do not agree, please discontinue using the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The SQL Parser Google Apps Script processes user-provided SQL code to generate tables within a Google Document. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive data to external servers. The data processed by the Service remains entirely within your Google Docs environment and is managed by Google’s data privacy practices.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>SQL Code:</strong> When using the Service, you provide SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO statements, which are processed locally within the Google Apps Script environment. The SQL code is not stored or transmitted by the developer.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Docs Access:</strong> The Service requires access to your Google Docs to create or modify documents based on your SQL input. It operates solely on the documents you explicitly create or allow access to. No other documents are accessed or modified.</li>
            <li><strong>Logs:</strong> The Service may use Google Apps Script logging features (e.g., Logger.log) for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. These logs are only accessible by you and do not contain any personal information. The developer does not have access to these logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-heading">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The SQL Parser Google Apps Script processes the data you provide (SQL code) only to perform the intended function of creating and appending tables to a Google Document. Specifically, we use your input data to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Parse and extract table structure and data from SQL code.</li>
            <li>Generate Google Docs tables based on your SQL input.</li>
            <li>Format tables to display column names, data types, and inserted data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not store, sell, or share your data with third parties. All data processing happens within the Google Workspace environment controlled by you.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">3. Permissions Required</h2>
        <p>The Service requires the following permission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Docs:</strong> The Service needs permission to access your Google Docs to create and modify documents where SQL tables are appended. This permission is necessary to deliver the Service's functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your data and documents remain under your control, and the Service will not access or modify any documents without your explicit permission.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously and strive to ensure your data is secure. Since the Service does not store or transmit your information externally, your data remains within your Google account and is protected by Google’s security measures.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security of Your Data:</strong> All operations performed by the SQL Parser Google Apps Script occur within the Google Workspace environment. Google maintains strict security protocols to protect your account and data.</li>
            <li><strong>Developer Access:</strong> The developer does not have access to your data or documents. Only you, through your Google account, can manage and control access to the documents created by the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-heading">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This Service does not use any third-party services or integrations. All operations take place within the Google Workspace ecosystem.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>As a user, you retain control over your documents and data. You can modify, delete, or revoke access to any document created by the Service at any time through your Google account. The SQL Parser Google Apps Script does not retain any of your data beyond the temporary processing needed to generate the tables in your Google Docs.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make any significant changes, we will notify you through the appropriate channels, such as updating this policy in the Google Workspace Marketplace.</p>
